# add SignedPower signedpower(x, a) = x^a
# scale(x, a) = rescaled x such that sum(abs(x)) = a (the default is a = 1)
# decay_linear(x, d) = weighted moving average over the past d days with linearly decaying weights d, d â€“ 1, ..., 1 (rescaled to sum up to 1)
# indneutralize(x, g) = x cross-sectionally neutralized against groups g (subindustries, industries, sectors, etc.), i.e., x is cross-sectionally demeaned within each group g
#ts_rank(x, d) = time-series rank in the past d days
# sign

# fix the short name collision problem
